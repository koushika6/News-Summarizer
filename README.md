# News Summarizer

## Overview

This project is an implementation of a news summarizer using the T5 transformer model. The goal is to generate concise and informative summaries for news articles, providing users with a quick understanding of the content.

## Features

- **T5 Transformer Model:** Utilizes the T5 transformer model, a powerful architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks.
- **News Article Summarization:** Given a news article, the model generates an abstractive summary.
- **Easy-to-Use Jupyter Notebook:** The implementation is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, making it accessible and easy to understand.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers library

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-summarizer.git
    cd news-summarizer
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook News_Summarizer.ipynb
    ```

4. **Run the Notebook:**

    Execute each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to load the model, input a news article, and generate a summary.

5. **Interpret Results:**

    The notebook provides detailed steps and explanations along with the generated summaries.

## Model Details

The project employs the T5 transformer model, pretrained on a large corpus of text data. The model is fine-tuned for the specific task of news summarization.

## Example

For a quick demonstration, refer to the [example.ipynb](example.ipynb) notebook, showcasing the summarization process on a sample news article.

## Results

The model's performance can be evaluated based on the generated summaries. Check the [results.md](results.md) file for detailed metrics and analysis.
